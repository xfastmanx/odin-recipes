        <h2 class="descheader">Description</h2>
        <p class="description">I was served white chocolate macadamia nut cookies at a restaurant in Springfield, MO, during a business conference. Went home and made up this recipe which has been a hit at any church gathering I take them to. They're even better than the one I had at the conference.</p>

        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
